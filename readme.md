## How to Use the Add-on

### The Main Dialog

The majority of the add-on's features can be easily accessed via a dialog box, which can be launched by pressing `NVDA+G`.  
As an alternative, navigate to the "Open AI" submenu under the NVDA menu and select the "Main Dialogâ€¦" item.  
Within this dialog, you will be able to:

- Initiate interactive conversations with the AI models for assistance or information gathering.
- Get descriptions of images from image files.
- Transcribe spoken content from audio files or through a microphone.
- Use the text-to-speech feature to vocalize written text in the prompt.

To further improve your interaction with the interface, please take note of the following:

- The multiline "System", "History", and "Prompt" fields come equipped with context menus filled with commands that can be quickly executed using keyboard shortcuts.
  These shortcuts are active when the relevant field is in focus.
  For example, the keys 'j' and 'k' allow you to navigate to the previous and next messages, respectively, when the focus is on the History field.

- Additionally, the interface includes keyboard shortcuts that are effective across the entire window. For instance, `CTRL + R` starts or stops a recording.

All keyboard shortcuts are displayed next to the labels of their corresponding elements.

### Global Commands

These commands can be used to trigger actions from anywhere on your computer. It is possible to reassign them from *Input Gestures* dialog under *Open AI* category.

- `NVDA+e`: Take a screenshot and describe it.
- `NVDA+o`: Grab the current navigator object and describe it.
- Commands not assigned to any gesture by default:
	- Toggle the microphone recording and transcribe the audio from anywhere.
